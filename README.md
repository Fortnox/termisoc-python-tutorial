# TermiSoc Python Tutorial

This is a bunch of examples to accompany a talk given by myself (Nick Charlton) at TermiSoc to introduce programming with Python.

This repo is forked from Ross Bearman's game example the first year it was given (academic year 2010-2011), but expanded to cover more ground and be more useful for people following along.

## The Examples

1. `hello_world.py` - a simple 'Hello World' example
1. `hello_name.py` - as 'Hello World', but with keyboard input
1. `fibonnaci.py` - looping around to generate 10 instances of the fibonnaci sequence
1. `tweets.py` - gets and prints the last 10 tweets from @TermiSoc
1. `adventure_game.py` - a starting point for a text based adventure game, using OOP
